# Checklist for project creation

Here is an opinionated checklist to follow when creating a new project.
Once you walk through it, you can delete it.

## Github repository

- [ ] Is it public or private as you planned?
- [ ] About (first page, click in the wheel icon)
      - [ ] Description
      - [ ] Topics
- [ ] Settings -> General -> Uncheck: Allow merge commits
- [ ] Settings -> General -> Check: Allow squash merging
- [ ] Settings -> General -> Uncheck: Allow rebase merging
- [ ] Settings -> General -> Pull Requests -> Check: Always suggest updating pull request branches
- [ ] Settings -> General -> Pull Requests -> Select: Automatically delete head branches
- [ ] Settings -> General -> Issues -> Suggest check: Auto-close issues with merged linked pull requests

## Codecov
If your repository is public, set up CodeCov to run with GutHub actions
by using [this guide](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/quick-start). If your
repository is _not_ public, consider removing the CodeCov github action
from ``/github/workflows``.
