# Installing {{ project_title }}

There are several ways to install a Python package. We strongly recommend
using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages and
projects in your system. For development we use `pixi` and is our recommended
way of installing it.

Some options are:

1. [Installing with Pixi (recommended)](#installing-with-pixi-recommended)
2. [Installing with PIP](#installing-with-pip)
3. [Installing with wheels](#installing-with-wheels)
4. [Installing with Conda](#installing-with-conda)


### Installing with Pixi (recommended)

We recommend using `pixi` to manage a Python environment with `{{ project_name }}` and all the required dependencies since it can reproduce exactly what we use for development.

1. Install `pixi` itself on your system. You only need to do this once, so you can skip this step if you already have `pixi` installed.

Please follow the instructions at [pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh) to install `pixi` on your system.

For Linux and MacOS:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
   ```

For Windows:
   ```cmd
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

2. Clone the {{project_name}} repository if you don't already have it.

3. Pixi provides support to use virtual environment with all the dependencies
   required. To do so, pixi uses the information from `pyproject.toml` and
   `pixi.lock` files, therefore, you need to move to where you cloned the
   repository. Once there, you can activate your environment by running:
   ```bash
   pixi shell
   ```

   You might notice a `({{ project_name }})` prefix in your terminal, which
   indicates that you are now in the `{{ project_name }}` environment.

   ```python
   import {{ project_slug }}
   ```

### Installing with PIP

`{{ project_name }}` targets Python {{ requires_python }} or newer.
Before installing, ensure the package requirements below are met and
then choose the environment manager that best fits your workflow.

#### Using `virtualenv`

1. Install `virtualenv` if needed:
   `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv`.
2. Create a new environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv-{{ project_slug }}
   source .venv-{{ project_slug }}/bin/activate
   ```
3. Upgrade pip inside the environment:
   `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
4. Install `{{ project_name }}` directly from the repository:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install "git+{{ repository }}"
   ```
   If you already cloned the repository locally, run
   `python -m pip install .` from the project root instead.

#### Using Conda or Mamba

1. Create a dedicated environment (replace `mamba` with `conda` if you
   prefer):
   ```bash
   mamba create -n {{ project_slug }} python=3.12
   mamba activate {{ project_slug }}
   ```
2. Update pip inside the activated environment:
   `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
3. Install `{{ project_name }}` from the repository, either remotely or
   from a local checkout:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install "git+{{ repository }}"
   # or, inside the cloned repo
   python -m pip install .
   ```

After installation you can verify everything is available by running
`{{ project_slug }} --help`.

### Installing from released Wheels

Start by downloading the wheels from
[the latest {{ project_name }} release]({{ repository }}/releases).
Once you have the correct wheel file, install it using pip:

#### Using `virtualenv`

1. Create and activate the environment as shown in
   [Installing with PIP](#installing-with-pip).
2. With the environment active, install the downloaded wheel (replace the
   filename with the one you fetched):
   ```bash
   python -m pip install /path/to/{{ project_name }}-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

#### Using Conda or Mamba

1. Create and activate the environment as shown in
   [Using Conda or Mamba](#using-conda-or-mamba).
2. Install the wheel inside the activated environment:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install /path/to/{{ project_name }}-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

You can verify the installation by running `{{ project_slug }} --help` in the
active environment.
